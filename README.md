This is a Pokemon Team Building website that will help you choose a well balanced team for mainline games!

Please checkout [richi3f's github](https://github.com/richi3f/pokemon-team-planner) and [projeffboy's github](https://github.com/projeffboy/my-pokemon-team) as I drew a lot of inspiration from these 2 projects! I just wanted to make my own little project with a new feature on it. But the majority of the work has come off of their shoulders!
