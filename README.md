This is a Pokemon Team Building website that will help you choose a well balanced team for mainline games!

Please checkout [richi3f's github](https://github.com/richi3f/pokemon-team-planner) as I drew a lot of inspiration from here! I just wanted to make my own little project with a new feature on it. But the majority of the work has come off of his shoulders!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
